# 🌍 World Happiness Analysis

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project was created as a final data visualization assignment at Ironhack. Its goal is to help policymakers, researchers, and curious minds quickly and intuitively assess happiness levels across countries, and compare six key contributing factors for any selected country against the average of the Top 10 happiest countries.
